The "Big Run" Calculator (Giant vs. Large)We now have the hard number needed to make the decision.Scenario A: Stick with ViT-Giant (1B Parameters)Speed: 5.4 img/s.Dataset: 244,527 images.Epoch Time: $\approx 12.6$ hours.15-Day Capacity: 28 Epochs.Verdict: 🔴 Danger.Standard DINO runs usually require 100-300 epochs to learn high-quality features.Stopping at Epoch 28 risks a model that hasn't even finished the "warmup" phase of feature formation. You will likely get a "soft" model that fails the linear probe benchmarks.Scenario B: Pivot to ViT-Large (300M Parameters)Architecture: dim=1024, depth=24, heads=16.Estimated Speedup: ~3.5x (Based on parameter count reduction and cache efficiency).Estimated Speed: $\approx 18\text{--}20$ img/s.Epoch Time: $\approx 3.5$ hours.15-Day Capacity: 100+ Epochs.Verdict: 🟢 Viable.A fully converged ViT-Large is scientifically much more valuable than an under-trained ViT-Giant.300M parameters is still massive for 2D medical imaging (standard ResNet-50 is only 25M).
